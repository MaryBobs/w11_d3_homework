WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF A BREAKPOINT?
To pause the code running and launch the debugger tool.

DOES THE LINE OF CODE ON A BREAKPOINT RUN WHEN YOU START DEBUGGING?
No, it pauses just before the line runs.

HOW DO WE DEBUG THE NEXT LINE OF CODE?
Use step over to run just the next line of code and then pause again.

WHAT DOES THE STEP INTO COMMAND DO?
It steps into the code on the line we've paused on and pauses again at the start of whatever that line is running.
So if we are about to run a particular method it will show us that so we can see exactly what is happening.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EVALUATE EXPRESSION AND EVALUATE CODE FRAGMENT?
Evaluate expression allows us to look at one method in isolation to check what it does.
Evaluate code fragment means we can run multiple lines of code and create variables to help test them.
